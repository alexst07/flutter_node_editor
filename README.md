## Getting started

To use the package you just need to add the dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  node_editor: ^0.0.5
```

or use the command:

```bash
flutter pub add node_editor
```

## Usage

To instantiate a NodeEditor object and start using the package, you just need to instantiate a focus node and a controller.

```dart
// (...)
final NodeEditorController _controller = NodeEditorController();
final FocusNode _focusNode = FocusNode();
// (...)
NodeEditor(
    focusNode: _focusNode,
    controller: _controller,
    background: const GridBackground(),
)
// (...)
```

#### Add a node
To add nodes in the `NodeEditor`, you just need to add any widget that inherits from `NodeWidgetBase`c. In this case, we add a `ContainerNodeWidget`, which functions as a traditional Flutter container. However, it is a node, meaning you can add input and output ports as child widgets, in addition to implementing operations like selection and movement within the `NodeEditor`.
To actually add the node, just call the `addNode` method of the controller object, and pass the node object to be added, as well as the initial position where it should appear in the `NodeEditor`.
```dart
// (...)
NodeWidgetBase exampleNode(String name) {
  return ContainerNodeWidget(
    name: name,
    typeName: 'node_3',
    backgroundColor: Colors.blue.shade800,
    radius: 10,
    width: 200,
    contentPadding: const EdgeInsets.all(4),
    selectedBorder: Border.all(color: Colors.white),
    child: // (...)
  );
}
// (...)
controller.addNode(
    binaryNode('node_3_1'),
    NodePosition.afterLast,
);
```

#### Implementing a complete node
A node used in real-world practice should have at least one input or output port. Often, a node has several input and output ports, in addition to various properties. An input or output port can be added anywhere below the node in the Flutter widget tree, as the ports use a Flutter mechanism to check which node is directly above them in the widget tree. Thus, ports can be added inside any other widgets such as Row, Column, among others. Another thing are some mandatory arguments, such as name and typeName, each node must have a unique name, while the typeName is a more useful parameter for performing checks, something that will be explained further ahead.
```dart
NodeWidgetBase exampleNode(String name) {
  return ContainerNodeWidget(
    name: name,
    typeName: 'node_3',
    backgroundColor: Colors.blue.shade800,
    radius: 10,
    width: 200,
    contentPadding: const EdgeInsets.all(4),
    selectedBorder: Border.all(color: Colors.white),
    child: Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
      children: [
        Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
          children: [
            InPortWidget(
              name: 'PortIn1',
              onConnect: (String name, String port) => true,
              icon: Icon(
                Icons.circle_outlined,
                color: Colors.yellowAccent,
                size: 20,
              ),
              iconConnected: Icon(
                Icons.circle,
                color: Colors.yellowAccent,
                size: 20,
              ),
              multiConnections: false,
              connectionTheme:
              ConnectionTheme(color: Colors.yellowAccent, strokeWidth: 2),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        Icon(Icons.safety_divider),
        OutPortWidget(
          name: 'PortOut1',
          icon: Icon(
            Icons.pause_circle_outline,
            color: Colors.deepOrange,
            size: 24,
          ),
          iconConnected: Icon(
            Icons.pause_circle,
            color: Colors.deepOrange,
            size: 24,
          ),
          multiConnections: false,
          connectionTheme:
          ConnectionTheme(color: Colors.deepOrange, strokeWidth: 2),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```
#### Types of Nodes and Their Properties
The NodeEditor has two main types of nodes, however, it's very easy to create your own custom node by simply creating a new class that inherits from NodeWidgetBase.
##### `TitleBarNodeWidget`

Provides a flexible and visually distinct way to represent nodes in a graphical editor, offering extensive customization options to fit the design needs of various applications. It is ideal for creating nodes that need a clear separation between their title area and content, making them easily identifiable and interactive within a node graph.

**Properties**:

**child**: A Widget that represents the main content of the node. This is where you place the interactive or display elements of your node.\
**icon**: A Widget (typically an Icon) displayed in the title bar, providing a visual representation of the node's purpose.\
**title**: A Widget that displays the title of the node in the title bar. It is typically a Text widget.\
**width**: The width of the node. It defaults to 150 if not specified.\
**titleBarColor**: The background color of the title bar. It can be used to differentiate node types or states.\
**backgroundColor**: The background color of the node's content area.\
**radius**: The border radius for the corners of the node, applied to both the title bar and the content area.\
**boxShadow**: A list of BoxShadow objects that define the shadow cast by the node.\
**border**: The border of the node when it is not selected.\
**selectedBorder**: The border of the node when it is selected, allowing for visual emphasis.\
**gradient**: An optional Gradient applied to the background color of the node, allowing for complex color transitions.\
**backgroundBlendMode**: The blend mode applied to the background gradient or color.\
